# Signal Interpretation Rules

Rules for correctly interpreting whether a signal indicates a buyer, competitor, or neutral company.

## Rule 1: Seller vs Buyer Distinction

If a company's **website content** mentions terms describing what the target product sells, they're likely a **competitor or adjacent vendor**, NOT a buyer.

**Example:** For an AR automation tool, a company whose website says "our collections automation platform" is a seller/competitor. A company whose job listing says "seeking AR Manager to reduce DSO" is a buyer.

**Application:** When a keyword has high lift but companies mentioning it are vendors in the target's space, flag it as a competitor signal, not a buying signal.

## Rule 2: Job Listings = Highest Intent

Hiring for roles related to the target's domain = very high buying signal:
- They have the pain point (they need the role)
- They are actively investing to solve it (budget allocated)
- They may not know automation exists (hiring humans instead)

**Application:** Weight job listing signals higher than website content signals. A company hiring 3 AEs is a stronger signal than a company with "sales" on their website.

## Rule 3: Tech Stack Correlation

Not all tech signals are equal. Consider whether the technology **correlates** with or is **inversely correlated** to the target's use case:
- **Positive correlation:** Technologies that create MORE complexity the target solves (ERP, CRM, payment processors for AR tools)
- **Inverse correlation:** Technologies that SOLVE the problem already (Shopify for AR tools — consumer payments are immediate, not invoiced)

## Rule 4: Source Context Matters

Same keyword means different things depending on WHERE it appears:
- **Product/features page:** Company SELLS this capability → competitor signal
- **Careers/jobs page:** Company NEEDS this capability → buyer signal
- **Blog/case study:** Could be either — evaluate if they're writing as vendor or sharing operational experience
- **Integrations page:** They connect to relevant systems → infrastructure signal

## Applying These Rules in Reports

When writing the interpretation column:
1. State what the signal indicates about the prospect's operations
2. Explain WHY it matters for the specific target company
3. Flag ambiguous signals (e.g., "Note: some companies mention this as vendors, not buyers")
4. For sales-specific keywords, note whether the source is primarily website or job descriptions
5. For tech stack tools, explain what the tool usage implies about the org's maturity and needs
